#Architecture  
The frontend is built with the flux design pattern, with the most significant stores immutable.  
Immutability is used for performance (`shouldComponentUpdate`).  
It uses superagent for HTTP requests. Generally data from a row is saved when that row loses focus.  
See the pivotal tracker board for a bug related to this.    

Resources are requested when a page-switch occurs (e.g. from jobs to a single job).

The backend is a hapi server, with models and handlers generated by functions found in `utils``.   
The generated models and handlers can have their methods overwritten if more specificity is required.    

Follow the instructions in the readme to populate the db with some dummy data so you can play around with the app.
